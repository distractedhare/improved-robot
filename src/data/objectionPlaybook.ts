/**
 * objectionPlaybook.ts
 *
 * Pre-baked objection handling playbook for T-Mobile virtual retail sales reps.
 * Covers both classic sales objections AND operational friction points
 * (account access, app resistance, wrong department, HINT unavailable, past-due).
 *
 * Design: Three layers of depth
 *   Layer 1 — Categories (tap to browse)
 *   Layer 2 — Specific scenarios with instant pre-baked quick responses
 *   Layer 3 — "Flip the Script" deep dive (powered by recommendation rules + AI later)
 *
 * When Gemma is integrated, it takes the pre-baked quickResponse text and
 * slightly rewords it each time to keep it fresh. The base content stays the same.

The good news is we're constantly expanding, and I can make a note to reach out when it opens up. In the meantime, have you looked at how much data your current phone plan gives you? A lot of our customers are surprised how much they can do with the hotspot alone.",

Here's what I can tell you though — our phone plans have seriously upgraded hotspot data. Depending on what you're using home internet for, we might be able to get you covered right now.",

Because a lot of people who come to us for home internet end up switching their phones too once they see the value. And honestly, if you switch now, you'll be first in line when home internet opens up in your area.",

If you're able to bring that current, I can immediately check what deals you qualify for. And I'm not going anywhere — I'll stay on the line.",
        tip: 'Be honest but not judgmental. You literally CANNOT see the financing screen. Frame paying the bill as the unlock, not as a punishment. And do NOT promise zero down or any specific deal — you genuinely don\'t know until the tools unlock.',

I know it's one more step, but once that's done, I can see exactly what promos are running for you. Sometimes people are surprised at how good the deals are once the account is clear.",
        tip: 'Don\'t be a pushover but don\'t be a wall either. The system literally won\'t let you — that\'s your shield. You\'re not the bad guy, the system is. But dangle the carrot: "the deals might surprise you." Curiosity keeps them engaged.',

The promo discount comes as a matching credit each month, so it cancels out. You're only paying the difference. And with the new 2026 trade-in policy, if you pay it off early, the remaining credits convert — so you don't lose them.",
