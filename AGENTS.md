# AGENTS.md — T-Mobile CustomerConnect AI (improved-robot)

_This file is the canonical instruction set for AI tools working in this repo.
Claude Code, Claude Cowork, Claude Desktop, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and any
other coding agent should READ THIS FIRST before modifying files. If you are
Claude Code, note that `CLAUDE.md` in this repo defers to this file._

## 1. What this repo is

This is the live T-Mobile CustomerConnect AI sales assistant — a React/TypeScript
PWA that helps virtual retail reps during calls. This repo (`improved-robot`) is
the **singular master** for the web app code. There are no other active forks.

GitHub: https://github.com/distractedhare/improved-robot

### Hard rule: one repo, one master

Do not create another fork, copy, or "improved-robot-v2". Do not nest a second
copy of this codebase inside `T-Mobile Sales Assistant/`. Do not clone this repo
into any sibling folder. If you need a scratch copy to experiment, use a branch
— not a new folder.

A previous fork (`customerconnect-ai` / the old `pwa/` folder) was retired on
2026-04-19 because the split was confusing every AI tool. Don't bring it back.

### Shared canon — know the three sibling folders

## 2. Tech stack

- React 19 + TypeScript
- Vite (build), Vercel (deploy)
- Tailwind CSS, motion/react, lucide-react icons
- Offline-first PWA (service worker, local generation)
- AI enhancement via optional remote calls, with local fallbacks

## 3. Folder layout inside this repo

```

### Where new things go

| New thing | Goes in |
|---|---|
| UI component | `src/components/` (or `src/components/learn/` / `levelup/` if it fits the subtree) |
| State/AI/storage logic | `src/services/` |
| Static lookup data | `src/data/` |
| Shared type | `src/types/` (or co-located if only one file uses it) |
| Scratch prompts / handoff docs | `T-Mobile Toolkit/archive/` — NOT this repo |
| Sales references / HINT PDFs | `T-Mobile Toolkit/sales-reference/` — NOT this repo |

## 4. House rules for AI tools

1. **Follow the design system.** The Magenta Pulse design system lives at
   `../T-Mobile Toolkit/design-system/`. Colors, typography, spacing, component
   behavior should come from there. When in doubt, read that folder before
   designing anything new.

2. **No root-level scratch files.** Don't drop `HANDOFF.md`, `PLAN.md`, `NOTES.md`
   at the repo root. Either commit the actual work or put scratch docs in
   `T-Mobile Toolkit/archive/` with a dated filename.

3. **Don't create parallel `-v2` files.** No `App-v2.tsx`, no `data 2.ts`. Edit in
   place; git is your history. Finder/Dropbox-style " 2.ts" files should be
   deleted on sight.

4. **Don't create new top-level folders without a reason.** If you think you need
   one, update this AGENTS.md first, then create the folder.

5. **`.deprecated/` is the local trash bin.** Don't reference, import from, or
   act on anything inside `.deprecated/` in any of the three workspace folders.

6. **When you finish a task, clean up after yourself.** Scratch files, test
   outputs, `.DS_Store`, `.playwright-cli/`, and similar artifacts should either
   be committed intentionally, gitignored, or moved to `.deprecated/`.

7. **Don't commit to main without asking.** B wants to review commits before push.

8. **Use relevant tools automatically.** Do not ask permission to inspect files,
   search the repo, read docs, check branches/commits, run tests, or validate
   the app. Ask only before destructive actions, deployments, merges, major
   architecture pivots, or when access is blocked.

9. **If you break one of these rules or spot drift, update AGENTS.md before
   fixing the drift.** Rules that aren't written down don't count.

## 5. Things AI tools have tripped over before

- **Two remotes on the same repo.** The old pwa folder had both
  `origin → improved-robot` and `neworigin → customerconnect-ai` set.
  This repo has exactly one remote: `origin → improved-robot.git`. Keep it that way.

- **GitHub branch pollution.** The `customerconnect-ai` repo accumulated many
  `claude/*` feature branches. If you create a branch here, prefer meaningful
  names and delete after merge.

- **Duplicate `2.ts` files.** Google Drive / Finder sometimes creates filename
  duplicates with " 2.ts" suffix. These are not real files — delete.

- **Google Drive sync deadlocks.** This folder is synced via Drive. If `rm` fails
  with "Operation not permitted", use `mv` to `.deprecated/` instead.

## 6. Salvaged files

See `.salvage-from-pwa/README.md`. Three components (`SupportPanel.tsx`,
`TransferBailout.tsx`, `LearnTagGroup.tsx`) from the retired pwa fork are
preserved there. They may or may not fit this repo's current architecture —
review before porting in.
